Issue:

1. Pictures have different height and weight which is called from API, 
I use black backgound color to solve the problem ,
make them display consistently, 
but the finally decision have to discuss.

2. Pictures title have different length, 
I set title height, and use 'â€¦' to replace the overflow words, 
but the finally decision have to discuss.

3. This is my first time use Docker, 
After studying online, docker image has been built successfully,
But If use docker conatiner can not read js, css path correctly, 
So this project has to be open in local index.html temporary,
And need more time to figure out this problem.
